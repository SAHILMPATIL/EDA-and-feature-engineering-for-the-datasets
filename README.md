# EDA-and-feature-engineering-for-the-datasets

A repository showcasing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** techniques on various datasets.

## Overview

This project provides Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to explore datasets, engineer meaningful features, and prepare data for machine learning models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps

- **1. Understand the Problem and Data:**  
  Define the objective and familiarize yourself with the dataset and domain context.
- **2. Data Collection:**  
  Gather relevant raw data from sources such as CSV files, databases, or APIs.
- **3. Import and Inspect Data:**  
  Load the data and perform initial inspection (e.g., checking data types, view top rows).
- **4. Handle Missing Values:**  
  Identify and address missing or null values by removing or imputing them as appropriate.
- **5. Explore Data Characteristics:**  
  Use summary statistics and visualize distributions to spot trends and irregularities.
- **6. Data Transformation:**  
  Convert, normalize, or encode features to make them suitable for analysis.
- **7. Visualize Data Relationships:**  
  Create plots (scatter, bar, box, etc.) to reveal relationships and patterns.
- **8. Handle Outliers:**  
  Detect and treat outliers that may skew analysis or model performance.
- **9. Communicate Insights:**  
  Summarize key findings with statistics and visualizations, and document insights for stakeholders.

## Feature Engineering Features

- **Feature Creation:**  
  Generate new features using domain knowledge, such as combining date fields or extracting part of a string[6][12].
- **Feature Transformation:**  
  Apply normalization (min-max, standard scaling), encoding (one-hot, label encoding), or mathematical transformations (log, sqrt, etc.)[6][12].
- **Feature Extraction:**  
  Reduce complexity and highlight important information using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA)[6][12].
- **Feature Selection:**  
  Choose the most relevant features through correlation analysis, statistical tests, or model-based methods[6][12].
- **Handling Missing Data:**  
  Use techniques like imputation (mean, median, mode) to fill in or handle missing values[6][9].
- **Dimensionality Reduction:**  
  Decrease the number of input variables to improve model generalization and computational efficiency[9][12].
- **Binning/Discretization:**  
  Convert continuous variables to categorical bins to simplify patterns[9].

# EDA-and-feature-engineering-for-the-datasets

A repository showcasing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** techniques on real-world datasets.

## Overview

This project provides Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to systematically explore datasets, apply essential preprocessing, and engineer features to prepare data for machine learning tasks.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps

- **1. Understanding the Problem & Data**  
  Define the predictive objective and become familiar with the datasetâ€™s structure and domain.
- **2. Data Collection**  
  Gather relevant datasets from available sources.
- **3. Data Import & Inspection**  
  Load data into the workspace and inspect types, missing values, and basic statistics.
- **4. Handling Missing Values**  
  Identify, quantify, and treat null or missing entries using removal or imputation methods.
- **5. Initial Statistical Exploration**  
  Generate summary statistics, visualizations, and distribution plots to uncover patterns and anomalies.
- **6. Data Transformation**  
  Convert, normalize, or encode variables for easier analysis or model building.
- **7. Relationship Visualization**  
  Use plots such as scatter, box, and bar charts to explore relationships and trends between variables.
- **8. Handling Outliers**  
  Detect unusual data points and decide whether to correct, remove, or retain them based on domain knowledge.
- **9. Communicating Insights**  
  Synthesize findings through concise visuals, tables, and narratives for stakeholders.

## Feature Engineering Techniques

- **Feature Creation**  
  Derive new variables from existing data using domain knowledge, such as extracting date parts or combining columns.
- **Feature Transformation**  
  Apply scaling (standard, min-max), encoding (one-hot, label, ordinal), or mathematical transformations (log, square root).
- **Feature Extraction**  
  Simplify and highlight important patterns using methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Feature Selection**  
  Use techniques like correlation analysis, statistical tests, or model-based selection to retain the most relevant features.
- **Missing Data Imputation**  
  Fill missing values using strategies such as mean, median, or mode imputation depending on the context.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**  
  Reduce the number of variables to improve model generalization and efficiency.
- **Binning/Discretization**  
  Convert continuous variables into categorical bins to reveal trends and simplify patterns.
